# HappyMinders
## Inspiration
As the year 2022 is coming to an end, it is time to reflect on what went wrong this year, what went right, and of course resolutions for 2023. Of course, we often forget what resolutions we had in mind as the months go by which is why I was inspired to create a feature that documents your reolutions no matter what whether you are able or disabled.

## What it does
This is a website that connects to an app that lets you document what your resolution is along with choosing whether you want to type it or speak it which gives you a choice or adapts to your abilities if you are deaf, blind, or mute.

## How we built it
I built this using Velo by Wix, twilio, html, css, and javascript.

## Challenges we ran into
I had some trouble creating the twilio feature in the beginning but was eventually able to figure it out. I also had a slow start this weekend but was ultimately able to finish this project. I also had trouble connecting the features to the overall websites.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I was individually able to create the twilio feature, documentation and accessability for people with disabilities features in one weekend while coming up with an idea.

## What we learned
I learned how to make a voice feature with Twilio and connect features to my website.

## What's next for HappyMinders!
 - Add more features for people with disabilities.
 - resolution reminders to phone numbers using Twilio
